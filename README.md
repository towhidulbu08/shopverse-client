# ShopVerse

ShopVerse is a modern e-commerce web application frontend built with **React** and **Vite**.  
It provides a fast, responsive, and scalable setup for building full-stack applications.

## Project Overview

ShopVerse allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and place orders.  
It also supports an admin panel for managing products and orders. This frontend is designed to work seamlessly with a Node.js + Express backend.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (separate repo)  
- **State Management:** React state/hooks (useState, useReducer, context)  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS / custom CSS  
- **Linting:** ESLint with React Hooks plugin  
- **Other tools:** Cookie parsing (cookie-parser), CORS support

## Features

### User Side
- Product listing with category filtering and sorting
- Cart management (add/remove products)
- Checkout page with order placement
- Authentication with JWT
- Responsive UI

### Admin Side
- Manage products (add, update, delete)
- Manage order status
- Access restricted to admin users

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Start development server with HMR  
- `npm run build` – Build production-ready frontend  
- `npm run preview` – Preview production build  
- `npm run lint` – Run ESLint for code quality checks

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-frontend-repo-url>
Install dependencies:

cd client
npm install
Start the development server:

npm run dev
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend folder and add:

env

MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>

If you want, I can also create a **shorter “interview one-pager README” version** that is **perfect to show on GitHub for recruiters**—highlighting skills, tech, and features without overwhelming details.  

Do you want me to make that version too?
